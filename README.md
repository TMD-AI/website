Overview
========
Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a significant public health and societal problem that manifest as pain and compromised joint and overall function, affecting up to 10\% of the population. Since pain frequently occurs with a plethora of mostly subjective symptoms, TMDs are often misdiagnosed, and treatments are frequently non-standardized and ineffective. While investments in TMD research have been made over the past several decades, there has been limited success in translating research discoveries to the clinic. Likewise, the heterogeneity in symptoms complicates understanding of disease etiology and mechanisms and impairs the development of evidence-based therapies. As a result, the complexity of TMD and the comorbidity of chronic overlapping pain conditions, such as headache, call for an interdisciplinary and multi-level approach to address TMD comprehensively using [GAIMs](https://socr.umich.edu/GAIM/).

To advance the clinical translation of innovative TMD/pain research, TMD-AI represents an integrated team of multidisciplinary collaborators that
addresses three critical knowledge gaps in TMD: (1) the lack of integrated deep-phenotyping approaches combining biological, clinical, and behavioral markers; (2) limited understanding of mechanisms driving acute to chronic pain transition; and (3) the need for objective biomarkers to enable personalized treatment. 

This project leverages advanced health technologies and AI/ML computational methods to transform TMD patient care. TBD-AI investigators integrate large clinical datasets using statistical modeling and large language models (LLMs) and conduct comprehensive patient phenotyping through 3D TMJ imaging, neuroimaging, and biobehavioral assessments. This work aims to create a robust mechanistic and clinical predictive model that will establish new standards for TMD patient care through stratification based on risk, severity, and comorbid conditions.

Goals
=====

    (1) Develop advanced AI/ML models for TMD patient stratification and precision medicine applications by integrating multi-modal clinical, imaging, and biomarker data, including salivary and synovial fluid.

    (2) Validate the performance and generalizability of the AI/ML models using independent, diverse TMD patient cohorts, and assess their ability to predict disease progression and treatment outcomes. 

    (3) Refine the AI/ML models based on validation results and integrate them with salivary biomarker data to create clinically actionable tools for personalized TMD management.
